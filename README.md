# Wind Drift Calculator

A comprehensive web-based aviation tool for UK PPL pilots, providing wind calculations, weather decoding, and interactive wind visualization.

## Features

### üßÆ Drift Calculator
- Calculate wind correction angles and ground speed
- Multi-leg flight planning with individual wind data per leg
- Master wind input that automatically cascades to new legs
- Individual wind override capability for each leg
- Import flight plans directly from Flight Plan Map
- Real-time magnetic variation

### ‚≠ê Wind Star
- 8-point wind reference (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- Ground speed and drift for all cardinal/intercardinal headings
- Quick visual reference for wind effects

### üå§Ô∏è Weather Station
- METAR decoder with flight categories (VFR/MVFR/IFR/LIFR)
- TAF decoder with day grouping and temporal organization
- Quick access to major UK airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, etc.)
- Human-readable weather translations

### üó∫Ô∏è Spot Wind Visualization
- Interactive map with real-time wind data
- Altitude selection from surface to FL100 (10,000ft)
- Time slider for forecast winds (0-24 hours ahead)
- Wind speed and direction at any point via bilinear interpolation
- Color-coded wind strength indicators

### ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Plan Map
- Click-to-add waypoints on interactive map
- Automatic distance and track calculations between waypoints
- Altitude selection for each leg (0-15,000ft)
- Automatic wind fetching at leg midpoints
- Departure time setting for accurate wind forecasts
- Export complete flight plan to drift calculator

## Technical Details

### Data Sources
- **Weather Data**: aviationweather.gov ADDS API
- **Wind Forecasts**: Open-Meteo API (no key required)
- **Map Tiles**: OpenStreetMap via Leaflet.js

### Key Technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript for calculations
- Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- CSS Grid for responsive layouts
- Local storage for user preferences

### Wind Calculations
- Uses standard wind triangle formulas
- Accounts for magnetic variation
- Interpolates between pressure levels for altitude
- Circular interpolation for wind direction

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The application is fully client-side and requires no installation.

### Navigation
- Use the tab buttons to switch between features
- Standardized navigation across all pages (dynamically generated)
- All times display in both Zulu (UTC) and UK local time
- Mobile-responsive design with 3-column grid navigation on small screens
- 5 main sections: Drift Calc, Wind Star, Weather, Spot Wind, Flight Plan

### Flight Planning Workflow
1. **Flight Plan Map**: Click to add waypoints, set altitudes, choose departure time
2. **Automatic Wind Fetching**: Wind data retrieved for each leg midpoint
3. **Export to Drift Calculator**: One-click transfer with all data intact
4. **Per-Leg Wind Control**: Fine-tune individual leg winds in drift calculator

## Browser Requirements
- Modern browser with ES6+ support
- Internet connection for weather data and map tiles
- JavaScript enabled
